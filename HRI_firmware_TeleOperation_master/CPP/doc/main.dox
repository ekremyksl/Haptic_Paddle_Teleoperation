/**
 * @mainpage HRI C++ interface documentation
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * This C++ interface is designed to control a HRI board through the serial
 * port. Unlike the MATLAB interface, it runs much faster, and allows complex
 * programs to interact with the HRI board.
 * It is using the Qt 5 library, which allows easy and clean code, while
 * while enabling high-performance graphics.
 *
 * The given interface essentially allows to interact with the board using the
 * synchronised variables system ("SyncVar"), for single read/write or
 * continuous data streaming.
 *
 * Two programs are included :
 * - HRI_PC_Controller is a ready-to-use application that allows to list, ready,
 * write, plot and log the SyncVars of the board.
 * - HriExampleProgram is a simple example that shows how to make a user
 * interface that can interact with the HRI board.
 *
 * @section support_sec Maintenance and technical support
 * Please report any bug or suggestion to Romain Baud (romain.baud@epfl.ch).
 * Technical support is also available.
